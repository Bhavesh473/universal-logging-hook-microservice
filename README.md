# Universal Logging Hook Microservice

## Overview
The Universal Logging Hook Microservice is a DevOps tool for real-time log capture, aggregation, and visualization from containerized web applications (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop). It hooks into Docker logs via Nginx proxy (JSON-formatted HTTP requests), aggregates with Fluentd, caches in Redis for fast queries, and provides a Flask-based dashboard for monitoring, filtering, sensitive event detection (e.g., POST/DELETE API calls), and metrics. This sets the foundation for a deterministic Replay Engine (future component) to replay user sessions from logs.

Built for scalability and observability, it supports multi-container environments and prepares logs for security auditing, performance analysis, and automated testing. Core tech: Docker, Nginx, Fluentd, Redis, Flask + Chart.js.

*Project Division (Team Split):*
- *Member A (Sumitra)*: Core service (API ingestion, processing, storage, security, async optimization, containerization).
- *Member B (Bhavesh)*: Integration & Ops (client libraries, auto-discovery, monitoring dashboard, testing, documentation, deployment).

Parallel development via API contracts; single repo for integration.

## Features
- *Log Ingestion*: Captures structured JSON logs from Nginx stdout (HTTP methods, paths, status, metadata like IP/user-agent).
- *Aggregation & Caching*: Fluentd parses/forwards to Redis (TTL-based queuing for real-time access).
- *Sensitive Event Detection*: Auto-flags high-risk actions (e.g., /api/BasketItems/ POST as SENSITIVE).
- *Dashboard*: Flask UI with live tailing, filters (level/source/search/time), metrics (events/min, error ratio), bar charts, expandable metadata, and toggles (sensitive-only/live mode).
- *API Support*: FastAPI endpoints for programmatic ingestion/queries (e.g., POST /logs, GET /logs?filter=...).
- *Security*: API key auth (via .env); metadata redaction (e.g., mask IPs in prod).
- *Ops Tools*: Multi-language clients (Python/JS/Go), CI/CD hooks (pytest/Jenkins), deployment templates (Docker Compose/K8s).
- *Extensibility*: Checkpointing for replay (sequence numbers, snapshots); async background tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Docker & Docker Compose (v2+)
- Git

## Quick Start
1. *Clone the Repo*:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Bhavesh473/universal-logging-hook-microservice.git
   cd universal-logging-hook-microservice
   

2. *Setup Environment*:
   - Copy .env.example to .env and configure (e.g., API_KEY=dev_universal_logging_key_2025_xyz).
   - Install Python deps: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. *Start Services*:
   
   docker-compose up -d  # Launches Nginx proxy, Juice Shop, Fluentd, Redis
   sleep 15  # Wait for init
   docker ps  # Verify all "Up"
   

4. *Launch Dashboard*:
   
   python dashboard.py  # Runs Flask on http://localhost:5000
   

5. *Test with Juice Shop*:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000 (proxied app).
   - Perform actions: Login (Google/email), search "apple", add to basket (Apple Juice, Banana Juice), remove item, logout.
   - Switch to dashboard tab: See real logs (e.g., POST /rest/user/login - SENSITIVE), metrics (e.g., 225 total, 48 sensitive), and apply filters.

6. *Stop*:
   
   Ctrl+C  # Dashboard
   docker-compose down
   

*Expected Demo Flow*: 10-15 sensitive events captured; error ratio <1%; live mode shows instant updates.

## API Usage
- *Base URL*: http://localhost:8000
- *Ingestion*: POST /logs (JSON body: { "level": "INFO", "message": "...", "source": "app", "metadata": {} }; header: X-API-KEY).
- *Query*: GET /logs?filter_level=ERROR&time_window=5 (returns filtered array).
- *Swagger Docs*: http://localhost:8000/docs (auto-generated by FastAPI).
- *Batch*: POST /logs/batch for high-volume.

Example (Python client):
python
import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
headers = {"X-API-KEY": os.getenv("API_KEY"), "Content-Type": "application/json"}
payload = {"level": "INFO", "message": "Test event", "source": "test-app"}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/logs", json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.json())  # {"id": "uuid", "status": "enqueued"}


See docs/api-specification.md for full spec.

## Testing
- *Unit/Integration*: pytest tests/ (covers log parsing, sensitive detection, Redis queries).
- *E2E*: Run ./scripts/test_e2e.sh (automates Juice Shop actions + dashboard assertions).
- *Postman/Swagger*: Test API endpoints with auth header.
- *Load Test*: Use locust (in scripts/) to simulate 100 reqs/sec.

## Deployment
- *Dev/Local*: Docker Compose (as above).
- *Prod*: Kubernetes/Helm (see helm/ dir); scale Fluentd replicas; use Redis Cluster.
- *CI/CD*: GitHub Actions/Jenkins templates in .github/workflows/ (e.g., build/test/deploy on push).
- Customize: ./scripts/deploy.sh (pushes to registry, deploys to K8s).

Details: docs/deployment.md.


## Contributing
- *Guidelines*: Fork → Branch (e.g., feature/dashboard-fix) → PR to main with tests/docs.
- *Member Focus*:
  - Sumitra: src/core/ (API, storage, security).
  - Bhavesh: integration/, docs/, scripts/, dashboard enhancements.
- *Issues*: Use GitHub labels (bug, enhancement, docs).
- *Code Style*: Black formatter; pre-commit hooks.
